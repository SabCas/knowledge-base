### 1.1 Chains 
Chains are sequences of calls to components, such as language models or tools. They can be composed to create complex workflows.

- **Types of Chains**:
  - **Simple Chains**: A direct connection between input and output.
  - **Complex Chains**: Combinations of multiple chains to create intricate workflows.

### 1.2 Agents
Agents leverage language models to decide which actions to take based on input. They can utilize various tools to fetch data or perform tasks.

- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic decision-making based on input context.
  - Integration with various APIs and data sources.

### 1.3 Memory
Memory allows LangChain applications to remember previous interactions and context, enhancing the conversational experience.

- **Types of Memory**:
  - **Short-term Memory**: Remembers the recent context of the conversation.
  - **Long-term Memory**: Stores important information across sessions.

### 1.4 Tools
LangChain supports various tools that can be used within chains or agents, such as:
- API callers
- Web scrapers
- Data processors
